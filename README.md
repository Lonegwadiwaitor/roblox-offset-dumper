# An offset dumper for the ROBLOX game engine.
Originally built for SirMeme Hub, a discontinued group project.

A fully fledged offset dumper which fully automates the dumping of every Lua offset automatically.

Last tested on `version-cdc9cb5aa0dc4432`, Does **NOT** work on 64-bit builds.

**For education purposes only, I do not condone the usage of such tools to build, update, or use cheat software.**

# Capabilities:
**Bruteforcing of ROBLOX's "`pointer obfuscation`", which can be done in nanoseconds with ease.**

**Bruteforcing of ROBLOX's "`VM shuffle`" macros, which can be used to bruteforce theoretically any shuffled Luau offset.**
